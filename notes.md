## React app with hot loading

Using the react hot boilerplate

```
mkdir react_hot; cd react_hot
git clone git@github.com:gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate.git .
rm -rf .git
npm install
npm start
```

You may want to change the host in server.js and webpack.config.js from localhost to 0.0.0.0 to allow access from same WiFi network or from vagrant.
